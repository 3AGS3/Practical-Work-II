      <h1>Subject Description</h1>
      <p>"Fundamentals of Computer Engineering" aims to provide a global vision of Computer Engineering in both
        academic and professional points of view. The course gives the students a grasp of the fundamentals on which
        this engineering is based (mathematics, physics, anthropology and ethics), the future professional careers and the
        role of a computer engineer in today's society. <br><br>
        The course is divided in two parts. the first part addresses the theoretical foundations, while the second helps
        develop practical skills. <br><br>
        The first part covers three fundamental blocks of content.
        1. Computer Engineering in Society: Background and historical perspective: past, present and future of Computer
        Engineering. Computer Engineering as an academic discipline or profession. The human factor: anthropological
        and ethical foundations. <br><br>
        2. Information and Data: Information representation. Organization of information.
        3. Information Processing, Management and Transmission: Fundamentals, current paradigms and trends in
        computer systems and applications. <br><br>
        The second part of the course is devoted to the development of practical skills where an introduction to web
        development is addressed, through the realization of a project for the creation of a web page on contents related
        to the course. <br><br>
        Besides providing the basics of a computer engineer technical skills, this course contributes to the development
        basic soft-skills for an engineer, such as teamwork, ethical commitment and communication skills, both oral and
        written, of technical information, favouring the comprehensive training of the engineer as stated in the educational
        project of the University. <br><br>
        The course "Foundations of Computer Engineering" is meticulously crafted to offer a holistic perspective of
        Computer Engineering, encompassing its academic and professional dimensions. <br><br>
        The main objective of this course is to acquaint students with the fundamental principles that underpin the discipline, including mathematical,
        physical, anthropological, and ethical foundations. Moreover, it aims to familiarize them with the diverse career
        opportunities available and the pivotal role assumed by computer engineers in contemporary society.
        This course is structured into two distinct modules. The initial module delves into theoretical foundations and
        encompasses three pivotal content blocks: <br><br>
        The first block critically examines the intersection of Computer Engineering and Society, exploring its historical
        antecedents, contextualizing its present state, and contemplating its future trajectory. Moreover, it elucidates
        Computer Engineering as an academic discipline and profession, and delves into the profound human aspects
        such as anthropological and ethical foundations. <br><br>
        The second block focuses on the fundamental principles of Computer Engineering, aiming to comprehend the
        inner workings of computers and identify their key components. <br><br>
        Finally, the last block revolves around Data management, processing, and communication. It not only
        elucidates the fundamental concepts but also explores current paradigms and emerging trends in systems and
        applications. <br><br>
        The second module of the course is dedicated to fostering practical skills. Herein, workshops play a pivotal role,
        fostering teamwork, the production of well-crafted printed documentation, and the delivery of impactful oral
        presentations to diverse audiences. Significantly, the laboratories provide an invaluable opportunity for students to
        gain hands-on experience in web development by embarking on a project centered around the creation of a web
        page exploring topics relevant to the subject. <br><br>
        In addition to the cultivation of technical competencies, this course espouses the development of essential skills
        requisite for future engineers. It emphasizes the significance of teamwork, ethical commitment, and effective
        communication skills, both oral and written, particularly in the technical domain. By embracing these overarching
        goals, this course aims to nurture well-rounded engineers who embody the comprehensive educational vision
        outlined in the university's educational project.</p>
